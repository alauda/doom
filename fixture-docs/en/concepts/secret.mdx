# In-Depth Understanding of Secrets

When it is necessary to store sensitive information or configurations that need to be kept confidential in a Kubernetes cluster, such as user passwords, OAuth tokens, SSH private keys, and authentication information for accessing image repositories, it is recommended to prioritize the use of Secrets (Kubernetes Secret) for storage.

## Usage Characteristics

- Compared to using plaintext configuration maps (Kubernetes ConfigMap), Secrets offer better security (sensitive information is stored using Base64 encoding) and have the capability to control the usage of sensitive information, thereby reducing the risk of data exposure.

- Using Secrets is more secure and flexible than storing sensitive information in Pod definition files or container images, making it easier to manage modifications.

## Supported Types

The platform supports the following types of Secrets created through UI edit mode.

- **Opaque**: A general type of Secret, which can be used to store passwords, keys, and other information, stored as Map key-value pairs.

- **TLS**: Used to store TLS protocol certificate and private key authentication information. For example: HTTPS certificate credentials.

- **SSH Key**: A pair of keys generated by asymmetric encryption algorithms, where the public key is configured on the server for encryption, and the private key is used by the client for decryption.

- **SSH Authentication**: Also known as ssh-auth, used to store authentication information for data transmitted over the SSH protocol.

- **Username/Password**: Also known as basic-auth, used to store username and password authentication information.

- **Image Service**: Also known as dockerconfigjson, used to store the JSON authentication string for private image repositories (Docker Registry).

## Usage Methods

- **Full Reference**: When setting up containers for native applications through a form, perform operations at the **Configuration Reference** section.

- **Partial Reference**: When setting up containers for native applications through a form, perform operations at the **Environment Variables** section.

**Note**: Instances of container groups in computing components can only reference Secrets within the same namespace.

When creating custom applications using YAML, please refer to the [Kubernetes official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets) for using Secrets (suitable for users familiar with Kubernetes and proficient in using YAML).
